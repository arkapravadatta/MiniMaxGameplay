    "#### Performance Measure\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Score:\n",
    " The primary measure of performance is the score, where each player earns points for correctly placing words and loses points for incorrect placements.\n",
    "Number of Words Placed: The goal is to place all available words correctly in the crossword grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Game Outcome: \n",
    " The game ends when all words are placed, and the player with the highest score wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Environment\n",
    "##### Crossword Grid:\n",
    " A 12x9 grid representing the playing field where words are placed. Initially, the grid is filled with '#' characters indicating empty cells.\n",
    "##### Words List: \n",
    " A list of words that need to be placed in the grid. The list is modified as words are placed and removed.\n",
    "##### Player Scores: \n",
    " Each player (AI and Player 1) has a score that updates based on correct and incorrect word placements.\n",
    "##### Turn Sequence:\n",
    " The game alternates turns between the AI and Player 1, with each player having an opportunity to place a word in the grid.\n",
    "#### Actuators\n",
    "##### Place Word:\n",
    " The ability to place a word on the grid at a specified position and direction (horizontal or vertical).\n",
    "##### Update Score: \n",
    " The system updates the score based on whether the word placement is correct or incorrect.\n",
    "##### Print Grid:\n",
    " The system displays the current state of the grid to the players after each turn.\n",
    "##### Print Scores:\n",
    " The system shows the current scores of both players after each turn or iteration.\n",
    "#### Sensors\n",
    "##### Check Word Fit:\n",
    " The ability to determine if a word fits at a given position and direction on the grid. This includes checking if the word can be placed within the grid bounds and whether it overlaps correctly with existing letters.\n",
    "##### Validate Input:\n",
    " The ability to ensure that player inputs (word choice, direction, and position) are valid. This includes checking for correct format and constraints.\n",
    "##### Current State:\n",
    " The system tracks the current state of the grid, the list of remaining words, and the current scores of the players.\n",
    "#### Data Structures and Fringes\n",
    "##### Data Structures\n",
    "##### Grid (2D Array): \n",
    " A 12x9 NumPy array to represent the crossword grid, where each cell can be '#' (empty), a letter of a placed word, or '*' (taken cell).\n",
    "##### Words List (List): \n",
    " A list of strings representing the words available for placement. It is updated as words are placed and removed.\n",
    "##### Scores (List): \n",
    " A list of two integers to keep track of the scores for Player 1 and the AI.\n",
    "##### Turn (Integer):\n",
    " An integer (0 or 1) representing the current playerâ€™s turn (0 for AI and 1 for Player 1).\n",
    "##### Fringes\n",
    "##### Fringe for Word Placement: \n",
    " A collection of potential placements (word, position, direction) that need to be evaluated. This includes possible positions and directions for placing each word on the grid.\n",
    "##### Fringe for Validity Checks:\n",
    " A collection of checks to ensure word placement is valid, including boundary checks and overlap checks.\n",
    "##### Fringe for Player Input: \n",
    "A collection of input validations to ensure that the player's choices (word, direction, position) are valid and correctly formatted."
